The unmodified cholesky bitcode leads cloud9 to complain "memory out of bound",
and cannot be intrepreted correctly.

Such a problem was fixed before and noted as below "note before 11/22/2019".
But the note was not detailed enough.
Now, I figure out that 

1. when linked with print.c/print2.c, the call to ReadSparse (line 19061 in a.out.ll) should
be commented out.

2. print.c implements a file I/O-based tracing.

3. print2.c implements the intrusive-tracing. 


note before 11/22/2019

#llvm3.7
llvm-dis CHOLESKY.opt.bc -o a.out.ll
Then, we also need to comment out ReadSparse in a.out.ll

#llvm3.1
llvm-as a.out.ll -o a.out.bc
