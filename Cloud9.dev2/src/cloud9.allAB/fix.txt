Fix a bug: main thread exits earlier than children thread. The fix multiplexes pthread_join's implementation and exploits the fact main thread in Cloud9 always has thread id 0. With the frontend inserting pthread_join(0,0), pthread_join puts main thread on every children threads' waiting list. when a child thread exits, it notifies main thread. 

Unfortunately, this is not a fix. Because main thread sleeps on all the children thread, any children thread wakes up main thread while exiting. The previous solution only works for 1 child thread.
